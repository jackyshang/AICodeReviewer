# Gemini Chat Session Persistence - Implementation Summary

## How It Works

### 1. **Core Concept**
Instead of creating a new Gemini chat for each review, we maintain a continuous conversation across multiple review sessions. The AI remembers all previous discussions, making it more effective at tracking fixes and understanding your codebase.

### 2. **Technical Implementation**

#### Session Storage
- Chat sessions are stored in `.llm-review/chats/` as compressed JSON files
- Each session contains:
  - Full message history (user prompts, AI responses, function calls)
  - Navigation state (which files were explored)
  - Review summaries from each iteration
  - Token usage tracking

#### Chat Persistence Method
```python
# After each review
chat.get_history() â†’ Save to session file

# On next review
1. Load session file
2. Create new chat instance
3. Provide continuation context with previous history
4. AI continues conversation naturally
```

### 3. **User Experience**

**First Review:**
```bash
llm-review --chat-session "auth-feature"
```
- Creates new session named "auth-feature"
- AI reviews code and remembers everything

**Subsequent Reviews:**
```bash
llm-review --chat-session "auth-feature"
```
- Loads existing session
- AI continues: "I see we're continuing from our last review where you had 3 issues..."
- AI knows what was already discussed and fixed

### 4. **Key Benefits**

1. **Natural Continuity**: AI remembers the entire conversation history
2. **Smart Focus**: AI knows what it already reviewed, focuses on changes
3. **Progress Tracking**: AI can tell you what's been fixed vs. new issues
4. **Context Preservation**: No need to re-explain your architecture

### 5. **CLI Usage Examples**

```bash
# Named sessions
llm-review --chat-session "feature-x"

# Auto-session (uses git branch name)
llm-review --auto-session

# List all sessions
llm-review --list-sessions

# Export session for sharing
llm-review --export-session "feature-x" > review-history.json
```

### 6. **Implementation Status**

âœ… **Completed:**
- Chat session storage structure (`ChatSessionManager`)
- Session save/load functionality
- Continuation prompt generation
- Export/import capabilities

ðŸš§ **Next Steps:**
1. Add CLI flags for session management
2. Integrate with `GeminiClient` to use sessions
3. Add session listing and management commands
4. Test the implementation

### 7. **Architecture Notes**

The Gemini SDK provides:
- `chat.get_history()` - Returns conversation history
- `chat.record_history()` - May allow history restoration (needs testing)

Since the SDK doesn't directly support session persistence, we:
1. Save the conversation history after each review
2. Create a new chat for the next review
3. Provide rich continuation context to maintain continuity

This gives us the benefits of persistent sessions while working within the SDK's constraints.
